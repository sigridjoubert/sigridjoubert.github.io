# Bain Turcot

An adaptive reuse project that transforms a 1909 bathhouse in Montreal’s Mile End into a civic space of secular worship.

From cairns to tombstones, ruins to Sisyphus— stone holds an archive of all we know. It marks grief, worship, territory. Its origins are violent: crushed, molten, the Earth breaking itself open. Formed long before us, they will remain long after. Here, stone is given reverence— through providing space for reflection, workshops, and collective ritual.
